# SeccyStuff
Assortment of scripts and tools I've written over the years for personal study. 

Currently there is a

  - Javascript de-obfuscator, very early stages
  #primary purpose was to automate the "search and replace" step of javascript-deobfuscation using regex and python dictionaries. 
    
    - v0.1 works on small number of sample files
    - v0.2 works better (on some malware), but doesn't deal well with edge cases. 
    
    Working on fixing these as I encounter more obfuscation techniques and get better at regex
    
    
   - Reg.py
      - Simple Reg.exe re-implemntation in python
      - Works reasonably well, but only supports ADD, QUERY, DELETE
